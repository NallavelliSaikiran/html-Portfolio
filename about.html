   <h3>Mini Project: Immunize Guide - A Vaccination Guidance Site:</h3>

  <p>During my academic journey, I had the opportunity to work on a mini project in the domain of web development. The project, aptly named “Immunize Guide,” aimed to provide comprehensive vaccination guidance to users. As we all know, vaccinations play a crucial role in public health, and having accurate information readily accessible is essential.</p>
   
   <p>In Immunize Guide, I designed and developed a user-friendly website that offers the following features:</p>
   <p>
       <ul>

          <li> Vaccination Schedules: Users can find detailed schedules for various vaccines, including recommended ages for administration and booster shots.</li>
          <li>Vaccine Descriptions: Each vaccine is accompanied by a concise description, highlighting its purpose, benefits, and potential side effects.</li>
            <li>Local Clinics and Hospitals: The site provides information about nearby clinics and hospitals where users can receive vaccinations.</li>
                <li>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs): To address common queries, I included an FAQ section covering topics like vaccine safety, efficacy, and potential risks.</li>
                    <li>The project aimed to empower individuals and parents with accurate information, ensuring timely vaccinations for themselves and their families.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Major Project: Soil Moisture Retrieval Using Groundwater Level:</h3>
   <p> 
       In addition to my mini project, I undertook a major project in the fascinating domain of Machine Learning. Titled “Soil Moisture Retrieval Using Groundwater Level,” this project explored the relationship between soil moisture content and groundwater levels.
    </p>
   
   <h3>Here’s an overview of the project:</h3>
       <ul>

           <li>Objective:</li>
          <p> Our goal was to develop a predictive model that estimates soil moisture based on available groundwater data.</p>
           <p>Soil moisture plays a critical role in agriculture, environmental monitoring, and water resource management.</p>
           <li>Data Collection:</li>
          <p> We collected historical groundwater level data from various monitoring wells across different regions.</p>
           <p> Simultaneously, we measured soil moisture content at specific locations using sensors.</p>
          <li> Feature Engineering:</li>
           <p>We extracted relevant features such as precipitation, temperature, and land cover type.</p>
           <p>These features were crucial for understanding the dynamics between groundwater levels and soil moisture.</p>
          <li> Machine Learning Models:</li>
          <p> Leveraging regression techniques, we built predictive models.</p>
          <p> Algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting were employed.</p>
          <li> Validation and Accuracy:</li>
           <p>We validated our models using cross-validation techniques.</p>
           <p>The accuracy of our predictions was assessed through metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).</p>
           <li>Application:</li>
          <p> Our model could be used by farmers, land managers, and policymakers to optimize irrigation practices and conserve water resources.</p>
           <p>Early detection of soil moisture deficits could lead to better crop yield predictions and sustainable water usage.</p>
           In summary, my major project aimed to bridge the gap between groundwater levels and soil moisture, contributing to more informed decision-making in agriculture and environmental conservation.
